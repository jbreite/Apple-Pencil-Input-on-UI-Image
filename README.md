# Apple-Pencil-Input-on-UI-Image
I have been trying to make an app where there is a notes bar on the left and then a picture on the left. 
I want to be able to use my apple pencil to draw over the UI Image on the left. However, the output says the pencil is writing, no pencil marks are being shown. 
I think this is because the output of the pencil is going under the UI Image. I would like the pencil output to go over the image.
